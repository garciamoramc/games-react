# React Games Hub

This project is a platform to practice and enjoy different mini-games implemented using React. It is designed to help developers become familiar with React Router routes and navigation menu creation, while also providing entertainment for users.

### Project Overview
The page consists of three different mini-games:
1. Memory Game: A classic memory game where you must match identical cards.
2. WPM (Words Per Minute): Test your typing speed with this word counting game.
3. Pokemon: Catch and collect Pok√©mon in this exciting capture game!

### Technologies Used
The project has been developed primarily using:
* React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* React Router: For managing routes and navigation between the different pages of the project.

# Getting Started

### What is react-confetti?

'react-confetti' is a React component that creates a confetti effect, commonly used to provide celebratory feedback or enhance user experience in web applications.

# Running the Application
